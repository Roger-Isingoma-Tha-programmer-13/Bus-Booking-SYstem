  <p>Mash East Africa has been also involved in other social corporate responsibility, such as assisting vulnerable children on transport requirements, religious functions, especially praying for peace in the country. We provide free transport whenever is convenient to government free medical camps in the rural areas. Every year we spear head a road safety campaign in conjunction with the Kenya traffic police to educate both drivers and passengers the measures to be undertaken in reducing accidents in the country. We at all times devote our efforts and energy to ensure fairness, safety and comfort is given the first priority amongst all the people we serve irrespective of their social class in the community. Road Safety Campaign Initiative Following the high rise carnage on Kenya roads, Mash East Africa Ltd in December 2011, in conjunction with the Kenya traffic police sponsored a road safety campaign dubbed “WANACHI WASHEREHEKEE SIKU KUU BILA AJALI” (LET PEOPLE CELEBRATE THE FESTIVE SEASON WITHOUT ACCIDENT). Our team headed by our General Manager, the training and road safety departments, decided to forfeit enjoying with their families during the festive season and embarked on the road safety campaign to ensure no single Kenyan was maimed or killed through road accidents. We organized a successful road safety campaign and for two weeks throughout the Christmas holidays; we all camped at a Manyani on the Mombasa Nairobi highway throughout the night, to ensure our mission is accomplished successfully. The Mash East Africa road safety team embarked on educating and advising passengers on their rights and how to differentiate between virtuous and horrific drivers. Passengers were advised to report to the next police post or roadblock if at all they came across a driver endangering their lives through reckless or careless driving. Buses were not allowed to move before ensuring every passenger had tightened his or her safety belt. Vehicles, which were found not complying with government traffic rules were impounded, drivers detained and charged by the Kenya traffic police. Drivers were also lectured by the Kenya traffic police and more so our highly trained Driver Instructors on matters of defensive driving, road courtesy, driving under fatigue, under influence of alcohol, avoidance of over speeding and uncalculated over takings on the road. Mash East Africa managed to ensure there was no single accident, which was witnessed over the holidays especially during the days we camped at Manyani between Mombasa -Nairobi highways. Records of this are readily available for verification from the Coast Province traffic police senior. The senior official professionally recognized our exemplary job in curbing accidents during the festive seasons. He even appealed to other stakeholders to emulate this gracious exercise by Mash East Africa, so as the same could be an ongoing exercise especially during such important and sensitive seasons in future. We therefore went down to history as the first public passenger transport company in Kenya, to have come up with such a caring Road safety initiative. We endeavor to continue this exercise as frequently as possible. In Mash East Africa we believe; it’s our prioritizing the safe guarding of the life of our passengers which keeps our business name unique and brings meaningfulness of our slogan “WE LEAD THE LEADERS” to us “SAFETY COMES FIRST”. </p>
